# Our Goal

Our goal is to model and visualize grains flowing into a grain silo using the Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) software.

# About LAMMPS

Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) is an open-source molecular dynamics software that makes use of Message Passing Interface (MPI) for parallel particle simulation. LAMMPS can be used to model biomolecules, solid-state materials, and coarse grain matters.

For the purpose of this Hackathon, we decided to use LAMMPS to carry out a Granular Chute Flow simulation of grain particles flowing into a cylindrical silo.
